# Test Preservation
- NEVER delete existing test cases or test files
- Preserve all tests that validate current behavior
- When refactoring, update tests only if functionality changes
- Add new tests for new features, don't replace existing ones
- Keep integration tests that verify end-to-end workflows
- Maintain test data and fixtures used by existing tests
