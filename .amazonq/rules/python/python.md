# Python
- you should test with pytest
- NEVER remove or modify existing test cases unless explicitly requested
- Keep all validation tests that verify current behavior
- When modifying code, ensure existing tests still pass
- You should pick-up Python version from ./venv environment and activate when not
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for code formatting
- Use f-strings for string formatting instead of .format() or %
- Only use f-string when they're is some values to concatenate 
- Handle exceptions explicitly with try/except blocks
- Use list/dict comprehensions when appropriate for readability
- Import modules at the top of files, grouped: standard library, third-party, local
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings
- Add docstrings for classes and public methods
- Use pathlib for file path operations instead of os.path
- Prefer context managers (with statements) for resource handling
