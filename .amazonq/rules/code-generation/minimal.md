# Code Generation Rules

## Minimal Implementation
- Write only essential code that directly solves the problem
- Avoid verbose implementations and unnecessary abstractions
- Skip boilerplate code unless explicitly required
- Focus on core functionality over comprehensive features
- Priviledge installed framework solution over custom code

## Code Style
- Prefer concise, readable solutions
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Minimize dependencies and imports
- Avoid over-engineering 
- Use simple solutions

## Documentation
- Add minimal comments only for complex logic
- Use self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Skip extensive docstrings for simple functions
- Focus on code clarity over documentation volume

## Error Handling
- Add error handling only where failures are likely
- Use simple try/catch blocks, avoid complex error hierarchies
- Handle only specific exceptions that need custom behavior
- Let appropriate exceptions bubble up naturally
